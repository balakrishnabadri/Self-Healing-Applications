# Self-Healing Applications

A Python + Streamlit project that uses a **Random Forest Machine Learning model** to detect anomalies in application logs and perform automated self-healing actions.  
This system demonstrates how applications can **self-monitor, self-diagnose, and recover automatically** without manual intervention.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning (Random Forest)**: Trains a model to classify log patterns and detect anomalies.
- **Self-Healing Logic**: Automatically triggers corrective actions when anomalies are detected.
- **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)**: Visualizes logs, predictions, and healing actions in real time.
- **Logging**: Maintains CSV logs of both raw system activity and healing actions.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balakrishnabadri25/Self-Healing-Applications.git
cd Self-Healing-Applications
```
### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
Windows

venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux

source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:

pip install scikit-learn pandas joblib streamlit
```
### 4. Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
This creates model.joblib which will be used for anomaly detection.
```
### 5. Run the Self-Healing System
```
python self_healing.py
```
### 6. Launch the Streamlit Dashboard
```

streamlit run dashboard.py
```
The dashboard will open in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).

### Simple Setup:
-> Install dependencies like python scikit-learn streamlit
-> python -m streamlit run dashboard.py

### 📊 Logs
logs.csv → Input log data used for training/testing.

actions_log.csv → Record of actions performed by the self-healing system.

### 🛠 Future Enhancements
Support for real-time streaming logs.

More advanced ML models for anomaly detection.

Containerization with Docker for easier deployment.

Integration with external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
